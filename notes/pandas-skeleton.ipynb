    "> . . . proceeding via a ‘dustbowl’ empiricism is dangerous at worst and foolish at best . . . . The purely empirical approach is particularly dangerous in an age when computers and packaged programs are readily available, since there is temptation to substitute immediate empirical analysis for more analytic thought and theory building.\n",

    ">. . . we can view the techniques of EDA as a ritual designed to reveal patters in a data set. Thus, we may believe that naturally occurring data sets contain structure, that EDA is a useful vehicle for revealing the structure. . . . If we make no attempt to check whether the structure could have arisen by chance, and tend to accept the findinds as gospel, then the ritual comes close to magical thinking. ... a controlled form of magical thinking--in the guise of 'working hypothesis'--is a basic ingredient of scientific progress. \n",
